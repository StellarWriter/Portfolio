# The Role of Network Segmentation in Cybersecurity and How it Works

Network segmentation, also known as network partitioning or zoning, is the practice of dividing a computer network into smaller, isolated subnetworks, known as segments or zones. This strategy can also be referred to as network isolation or subdividing, depending on the specific context and goals. By enhancing security, reducing attack surfaces, and improving network performance, network segmentation plays a crucial role in maintaining organizational integrity and operational efficiency. Its application is varied, serving different needs across industries and organizational structures.

## What is Network Segmentation?

Network segmentation is a fundamental network security strategy that involves dividing a large, flat computer network into smaller, independent subnetworks or segments. Each segment is isolated from the others, operating as its own mini-network with defined access controls and security policies. This process enhances network segmentation security and helps in maintaining the health of a segmented network.

The primary objective of network segmentation is to improve overall cybersecurity by limiting the lateral movement of threats and potential attackers within the network. In a traditional flat network, where all devices and systems are part of a single domain, a breach in one part could grant attackers access to sensitive resources throughout the entire infrastructure. Network segmentation mitigates this risk by creating barriers between segments, ensuring attackers' access remains limited to a specific zone.

## How Does Network Segmentation Work?

Network segmentation employs various strategies to create an optimal environment for safeguarding organizational assets.
### Network Segmentation Techniques

Different techniques can be used in network segmentation, each catering to specific needs and offering unique advantages:

- **VLAN Segmentation**: VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) segmentation is a network segmentation tool that allows different devices to communicate as if they are part of the same physical network, regardless of their actual physical location. It effectively manages traffic and reduces congestion by grouping devices with similar requirements.
- **Subnetting**: This strategy divides an IP network into smaller, more manageable pieces. By isolating different parts of the network, subnetting improves performance and security, offering a systematic way to organize and protect network resources.
- **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**: ACLs are used to control user access within a network, thereby enhancing network segmentation security. They define rules that grant or deny permissions to specific IP addresses, contributing to a more secure and controlled environment.

[Microsegmentation](https://www.ericom.com/glossary/what-is-microsegmentation) is another network segmentation technique that takes segmentation to a more granular level. Unlike traditional methods, which typically segment the network at the switch or router level, microsegmentation isolates individual workloads, providing more precise control over data flow and interactions. By applying security policies at a micro-level, organizations can have a more targeted defense against potential threats, reducing risks and adding an extra layer of protection.


### Implementation Strategies for Network Segmentation

Network segmentation, vital for enhancing security and improving performance, can be implemented through two main strategies, each catering to unique needs and environments:
#### Physical Network Segmentation

Physical network segmentation involves creating distinct network segments using separate physical devices like switches or routers. This approach provides a robust separation, with each segment physically isolated from the others.

**Advantages:**
- **Security**: Ensures a high level of protection by physically separating segments.
- **Performance**: Enhances network performance and reduces congestion by isolating network traffic.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Cost and Complexity**: This method may involve higher costs and increased complexity due to additional hardware requirements.

**Use Case Example**: Data centers might apply physical network segmentation to separate different customers' environments or isolate mission-critical systems.

#### Logical Network Segmentation

Logical network segmentation is achieved through software, utilizing technologies like VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) or firewall rules. It allows for flexibility and scalability, adapting to the organization's evolving needs.

**Advantages:**
- **Flexibility**: Permits the creation of adaptable network segments without the need for additional physical hardware.
- **Scalability**: Can be easily expanded as the organization grows to include new systems or users.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Usually requires less investment in hardware, making it a more cost-efficient solution.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Security Considerations**: While offering flexibility, logical segmentation must be carefully configured and monitored to ensure robust security.

**Use Case Example**: A university might implement logical network segmentation to separate student, faculty, and administrative networks, allowing for tailored access controls and security policies for each group.

#### Choosing the Right Strategy

Selecting the right network segmentation strategy depends on various factors such as organizational size, security requirements, budget constraints, and existing network infrastructure. A combination of both physical and logical segmentation might also be considered to leverage the benefits of both approaches. [Consulting with network security experts](https://www.ericom.com/contact-us) and conducting a thorough assessment of the organization's needs and risks will guide the decision-making process. This ensures that the chosen strategy aligns with the overall security posture and operational goals, making the most out of network segmentation's potential benefits.

## Use Cases for Network Segmentation

Network segmentation plays an essential role in ensuring the security, compliance, and efficiency of an organization's network, allowing organizations to control access, improve performance, and comply with various industry regulations. Organizations employ network segmentation appropriate to their unique requirements, bolstering their security posture and enhancing their operational effectiveness.

Network segmentation has become an integral part of modern cybersecurity strategies and is being implemented in various ways to cater to the specific requirements of different industries.

**Payment Card Industry (PCI) Compliance**: In the retail industry, network segmentation is implemented to separate payment systems from other network segments. This ensures the protection of sensitive credit card information. A real-world example would be a global retailer using segmentation to isolate the Point of Sale (POS) systems from other network domains.

**Healthcare Industry Compliance (HIPAA)**: For hospitals and healthcare providers, network segmentation is crucial to protect patient data and comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). An example would be a large hospital network implementing segmentation to isolate patient records and medical devices from administrative systems, ensuring patient privacy and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

**Government and Defense Agencies**: Military networks and the defense sector uses network segmentation to separate classified and non-classified information, employing segmentation to protect sensitive military information and mission-critical systems.

**Financial Institutions**: For banks and investment firms network segmentation is used to separate consumer banking systems from investment and internal operations. For example, large banks may use segmentation to protect customer account data from potential breaches and ensure compliance with financial regulations.

**Educational Institutions**: Universities and schools often implement network segmentation to separate administrative systems from student and faculty access. An example could be a university employing network segmentation to protect research data, student records, and financial information while enabling secure access for educational purposes.

## Benefits of Network Segmentation

Network segmentation plays a pivotal role in enhancing an organization's security and efficiency. By isolating different parts of a network, segmentation offers more controlled access and optimized performance across various industries. Whether it's protecting sensitive information, limiting the potential spread of cyberattacks, or meeting specific regulatory compliance requirements, the benefits of network segmentation are broad and varied. The following subsections explore these advantages in more detail across different scenarios and applications:
#### Improve Operational Performance
Segmentation minimizes network congestion, enhancing overall operational performance. For example, in a hospital, medical devices can be segmented from the visitor network, ensuring that essential medical functions are unaffected by heavy web browsing. In a corporate environment, segmentation can separate different departments, ensuring that critical business applications run smoothly without interference from other departments' network traffic.
#### Limit Cyberattack Damage
Segmentation fortifies cybersecurity by restricting how far an attack can penetrate. For instance, if malware infects one section of a business network, segmentation can prevent it from spreading to other areas. In an educational institution, segmentation could isolate student devices from administrative systems, thus preventing a potential breach in student devices from impacting sensitive administrative data.
#### Facilitate Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting
Network segmentation in a large manufacturing company can separate production line systems from office workstations, enabling more efficient monitoring and troubleshooting.
